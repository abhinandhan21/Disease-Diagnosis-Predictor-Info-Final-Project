# Disease & Diagnosis Predictor
Abstract: 
The Disease & Diagnosis Predictor is an advanced web application designed for disease prediction and diagnosis assessment. The primary dataset used for this project is the "Diabetes Prediction Dataset," which includes attributes such as Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, and Age. The application goes beyond diabetes prediction, incorporating modules for liver, kidney, and heart disease prediction. The implemented machine learning algorithms include Random Forest and Decision Tree, providing users with accurate predictions and insights into potential health conditions.
Data Description: 
The primary dataset for the Diabetes Prediction module contains attributes related to health indicators such as pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, and age. The dataset has undergone extensive cleaning and preprocessing to ensure its suitability for machine learning analysis. It serves as the foundation for the Diabetes Prediction module, offering users the ability to assess their risk of diabetes based on the provided attributes.
Additional Disease Modules:
 In addition to the Diabetes Prediction module, the application includes modules for liver, kidney, and heart disease prediction. Each module is tailored to the specific health condition, incorporating relevant attributes for accurate predictions. Users can seamlessly switch between modules, obtaining comprehensive insights into various potential health risks.
Algorithms Description:
 The Disease & Diagnosis Predictor employs two robust machine learning algorithms: Random Forest and Decision Tree. These algorithms are chosen for their effectiveness in handling both classification tasks and complex datasets. Random Forest, known for its ensemble learning approach, enhances prediction accuracy by aggregating multiple decision trees. Decision Tree, on the other hand, provides transparency into the decision-making process, aiding in the interpretability of the predictions. Both algorithms contribute to the application's capability to deliver reliable and precise health predictions.


Tools Used:
 Python: The core programming language for data analysis, machine learning, and web application development.
Pandas: Utilized for data manipulation and preprocessing tasks, ensuring the dataset's cleanliness and readiness for analysis.
Scikit-learn: Integrated for the implementation of machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest and Decision Tree.
Streamlit: The backbone of the web application, providing an intuitive and interactive user interface for inputting health indicators and obtaining predictions.
GitHub: The project repository is hosted on GitHub, facilitating version control, collaboration, and accessibility.
Backblaze (Backup): The primary storage for datasets, with a backup available on the app's GitHub repository.
